    <h1>Welcome to Elektronica</h1>
    <p>
      The Electronics Club aims at teaching and helping students understand the seemingly incomprehensible electronic gadgets in the world today, and also assists people in developing their own devices. It strives to create interest in the students
      for electronics.
      ELEKTRONICA was launched by a few students of IITH the year 2012, with a vision to build a club that strives to create interest in electronics to all students and to help them excell in their projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of now, we have 2 Co-Ordinators and 26 Core Members. Membership is given on the basis of enthusiasm shown in the various activities of the club throughout the semester.
      <br></br>
      Co-Ordinators : Srihith, Akhil
